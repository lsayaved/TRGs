# Toxin-related genes (TRGs)
Collection of scripts to look for the TRGs described in the paper [Abundant toxin-related genes in the genomes of beneficial symbionts from deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels](https://elifesciences.org/content/4/e07966)

Looking for toxin-related genes (TRGs) in bacterial genomes is not a straightforward task. The functional domains have often a mosaic-like structure that makes classification a difficult task. To look for TRGs in multiple genomes without the pain of doing it manually, I created a workflow of classification for the follow up paper "Comparative genomic inisghts into the roles of toxin-realted genes in the beneficial bacteria and their acquisition by horizontal gene transfer" (in prep).

1. Blast protein sequences of the genomes you want to look at against the TRG proteins from the Bathy SOX described in [Sayavedra et al., 2015] (https://elifesciences.org/content/4/e07966).
```
blastp -query Genomes.faa -db ~/ownCloud/ToxinsOtherSOXs/BLAST/bathyt_toxins.faa -max_target_seqs 50 -outfmt "6 std qcovs" -evalue 0.001 -out Genes2Search_vsTRGs.txt
```
 - Use mnimum similarity of 25, minimum alignment of 200, minimum coverage of 15
 ```
 cat Genes2Search_vsTRGs.txt  | awk '{if ($3>25 && ($13>25 && $4>50) || ($13>15 && $4>200) ) print $0}' | perl -pe "s/(\S+).*/\1/" | sort -u  >Genes2Search_vsTRGs.blastSim25Cov25.txt
 ```
2. Submit genes from the TRGs paper to the CD-Search Tool, standard settings
3. Download results full, include query defline
4. Use the list that describes which domains are associated to which class of toxins [DomainsClassifier.txt]()

 ```
perl ~/Dropbox/perl_scripts/Findidentifiers_printseq.pl -inident BLAST_possibleToxinsInRelativesIDsSIm25COv50.txt -inseq /Users/lsayaved/ownCloud/ToxinsOtherSOXs/SpeciesTree/fnnGenomes/Genes2Search.faa  -o BLAST_possibleToxinsInRelativesSIm25COv50.faa
 ```
 
```
perl ClassifyTRGs.pl -domains DomainsClassifier.txt -CPD PossibleTRGsSim25Cov50Aln50_hitdata.txt  -faa ~/ownCloud/ToxinsOtherSOXs/MassiveClassiffier/BLAST_possibleToxinsInRelativesSIm25COv50.faa.fas -genids GenomeTags.txt -out PossibleTRGsSim25Cov50Aln50
 ```
