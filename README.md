# Toxin-related genes (TRGs)
Collection of scripts to look for the TRGs described in the paper [Abundant toxin-related genes in the genomes of beneficial symbionts from deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels](https://elifesciences.org/content/4/e07966)

Looking for toxin-related genes (TRGs) in bacterial genomes is not a straightforward task. The functional domains have often a mosaic-like structure that makes classification a difficult task. To look for TRGs in multiple genomes without the pain of doing it manually, I created a workflow of classification for the follow up paper "Comparative genomic inisghts into the roles of toxin-realted genes in the beneficial bacteria and their acquisition by horizontal gene transfer".
